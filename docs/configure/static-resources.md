# Static Resources

## Introduction

Make a `assets` folder, and put all your static resources under it.

```
|-docs
  |-assets
    |-tree-house-ipa.jpeg
    |-dump-beer.gif
  |-ReadMe.md
```

All these resources will move to your `docs-dist` folder, Docit will handle `public path` for you.

## Usage

To use assets

> Don't put `/` before image path

```md
![Tree House IPA](tree-house-ipa.jpeg)
```

![Tree House IPA](tree-house-ipa.jpeg)

```md
![Dump Beer](dump-beer.gif)
```

![Dump Beer](/dump-beer.gif)
