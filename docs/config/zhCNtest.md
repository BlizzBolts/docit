## 出师表

先帝创业未半而中道崩殂，今天下三分，益州疲弊，此诚危急存亡之秋也。然侍卫之臣不懈于内，忠志之士忘身于外者，盖追先帝之殊遇，欲报之于陛下也。诚宜开张圣听，以光先帝遗德，恢弘志士之气，不宜妄自菲薄，引喻失义，以塞忠谏之路也。

宫中府中，俱为一体，陟罚臧否，不宜异同。若有作奸犯科及为忠善者，宜付有司论其刑赏，以昭陛下平明之理，不宜偏私，使内外异法也。

侍中、侍郎郭攸之、费祎、董允等，此皆良实，志虑忠纯，是以先帝简拔以遗陛下。愚以为宫中之事，事无大小，悉以咨之，然后施行，必能裨补阙漏，有所广益。

将军向宠，性行淑均，晓畅军事，试用于昔日，先帝称之曰能，是以众议举宠为督。愚以为营中之事，悉以咨之，必能使行阵和睦，优劣得所。

亲贤臣，远小人，此先汉所以兴隆也；亲小人，远贤臣，此后汉所以倾颓也。先帝在时，每与臣论此事，未尝不叹息痛恨于桓、灵也。侍中、尚书、长史、参军，此悉贞良死节之臣，愿陛下亲之信之，则汉室之隆，可计日而待也。

臣本布衣，躬耕于南阳，苟全性命于乱世，不求闻达于诸侯。先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顾臣于草庐之中，咨臣以当世之事，由是感激，遂许先帝以驱驰。后值倾覆，受任于败军之际，奉命于危难之间，尔来二十有一年矣。

先帝知臣谨慎，故临崩寄臣以大事也。受命以来，夙夜忧叹，恐托付不效，以伤先帝之明，故五月渡泸，深入不毛。今南方已定，兵甲已足，当奖率三军，北定中原，庶竭驽钝，攘除奸凶，兴复汉室，还于旧都。此臣所以报先帝而忠陛下之职分也。至于斟酌损益，进尽忠言，则攸之、祎、允之任也。

愿陛下托臣以讨贼兴复之效，不效，则治臣之罪，以告先帝之灵。若无兴德之言，则责攸之、祎、允等之慢，以彰其咎；陛下亦宜自谋，以咨诹善道，察纳雅言，深追先帝遗诏，臣不胜受恩感激。

今当远离，临表涕零，不知所言。

诸葛亮（181－234），字孔明，号卧龙（也作伏龙），汉族，徐州琅琊阳都（今山东临沂市沂南县）人，三国时期蜀汉丞相，杰出的政治家、军事家、散文家、书法家、发明家。在世时被封为武乡侯，死后追谥忠武侯，东晋政权因其军事才能特追封他为武兴王。诸葛亮为匡扶蜀汉政权，呕心沥血，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。其散文代表作有《出师表》、《诫子书》等。曾发明木牛流马、孔明灯等，并改造连弩，叫做诸葛连弩，可一弩十矢俱发。于建兴十二年即234年在五丈原（今宝鸡岐山境内）逝世。诸葛亮在后世受到极大尊崇，成为后世忠臣楷模、智慧化身。成都、宝鸡、汉中、南阳等地有武侯祠，杜甫作《蜀相》赞诸葛亮。

## Back to the Drawing Board

Over the last few years, I’ve had a series of unfortunate events that created some big changes in my life. My wife came out, we divorced, and I was laid off — those are just the highlights.

Understandably, I was in an existential slump.

An old friend of mine suggested I get back into drawing. For as long as I can remember I have doodled all over anything I could. Before getting into poetry, I wanted to be an animator or a cartoonist.

The “funnies” were my favorite section of the newspaper. I read them daily, especially on Sunday. I often doodled characters and comics when I should have been paying attention in class.

In high school, I began to write poetry. My poems were often accompanied by doodles. My interest and skill in art led me to a career in graphic design and marketing. As the years went by, drawing for fun faded away.

Now that I was in a moment of crisis, my friend’s words called me back to the pencil and paper I had left behind.

Years before the divorce, I had signed up for an art school online, the School of Visual Storytelling. I had started classes but life caught up to me. I decided to go back to it to help jump-start my journey back to myself.

Going back to the basics helped get my brain reconnected to my hand, a connection I was not aware was severed. It felt good drawing shapes over and over. A task I hated in college. Shapes turned to objects, and objects became characters. One day I realized I was drawing the same two characters. One was a scruffy-looking muppet character, the other was a blocky Cyclops.

After some sketching and writing, I made my first comic.

## Surgeons perform second pig heart transplant, trying to save a dying man 外科醫生進行第二次猪心臟移植 試圖挽救垂死男子

◎陳成良

Surgeons have transplanted a pig’s heart into a dying man in a bid to prolong his life – only the second patient to ever undergo such an experimental feat. Two days later, the man was cracking jokes and able to sit in a chair, Maryland doctors said Friday.

外科醫生將一顆猪Surgeons have transplanted a pig’s的心臟移植到一名垂死男子身上，以延長他的生命，這是第二名經歷這種實驗壯舉的患者。馬里蘭州醫生週五表示，兩天後，這名男子開始開玩笑，並且能夠坐在椅子上。

The 58-year-old Navy veteran was facing near-certain death from heart failure but other health problems meant he wasn’t eligible for a traditional heart transplant, according to doctors at University of Maryland Medicine.

馬里蘭大學醫學院的醫生表示，這名58歲的海軍老兵因心臟衰竭幾乎必死無疑，但其他健康問題意味著他沒有資格接受傳統的心臟移植手術。

The same Maryland team last year performed the world’s first transplant of a genetically modified pig heart into another dying man, David Bennett, who survived just two months.

去年，馬里蘭州的同一個團隊將世界上第一顆基因改造猪心臟，移植到另一名垂死的男子大衛‧貝內特身上，他只活了兩個月。

There’s a huge shortage of human organs donated for transplant. Last year, there were just over 4,100 heart transplants in the U.S., a record number but the supply is so tight that only patients with the best chance of long-term survival get offered one. （AP）

捐贈用於移植的人體器官嚴重短缺。去年，美國有4100多例心臟移植，這是一個創紀錄的數目，但供應非常吃緊，只有最有可能長期存活的病患才能獲得移植手術。（美聯社）
