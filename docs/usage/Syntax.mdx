# Syntax

Docit is a MDX & MD oriented document tool.

It's based on MDX and MD syntax, and support with some others to fit your needs.

## MDX

MDX is a syntax that enable writing JSX and JavaScript expressions in your Markdown files.

```md
# Title 1

## Title 2

{ console.log({str: 'hello world!'})}

export const MyComponent = () => <strong>Coffee Time</strong>

<MyComponent />
```

Check out [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) for more.

## Live Block

Live Block is a way to speed up your doc writing by rendering and showing code at the same time.

Just add `live` keyword after code block language

> The code you writing is rendered in a sandbox(iframe), and also a JavaScript sandbox (serving as an independent dynamic import).

### Syntax

````md
```jsx live
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

This will render as

```jsx live
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```

### Why?

Markdown naturally has code block syntax

For Example:

````md
```jsx
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

Your markdown might look like

````md
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";

<DemoBlock />;

```jsx
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

You will find that you write the statement twice.

And if your code has changes, you need to apply the changes twice.

## Mobile View

### Syntax

````md
```jsx live mobile
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

Docit also support live mobile block. Add a `mobile` keyword after `live` to enable it.

```jsx live mobile
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```

Docit provides a `360 * 640` mobile view to help you display responsive component

## API Generation

Docit provides a simple syntax to handle auto API parsing.

> Currently only support React Typescript API Tables. Functions and Interface support might not work as you expected.

### Syntax

```md
[Props](../components/Button.tsx)
```

Inside Docit, it will check the text name to be `Props` and resolve your component path using [resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve)

For Example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import styled from "styled-components";

enum Length {
  /**
   * Large
   */
  Large = 5,
  /**
   * 中
   */
  Medium = 3,
  /**
   * 小
   */
  Small = 1,
}

interface ButtonProps extends HTMLButtonElement {
  /**
   * 一种颜色
   * @default red
   */
  color?: string;
  length: Length;
}

export const StyledButton = styled.button`
  z-index: 9999;
`;

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = () => {
  return <StyledButton>1</StyledButton>;
};

Button.defaultProps = {
  color: "green",
  length: Length.Large,
};

export { Button };
```

The API table will look like:

[Props](../components/ApiTest.tsx)

You will notice `StyledButton` get exported, but the api table does not appear, thats because the type parser got nothing from parsing it.

---

since Docit using `resolve`, you can actually parsing some third party types like

```md
[Props](antd-mobile/es/index.d.ts)
```
