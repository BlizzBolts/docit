# Live Block

Live Block is a way to speed up your doc writing by rendering and showing code at the same time.

Just add `live` keyword after code block language

Docit only respect `live` keyword for `js` `jsx` `ts` and `tsx` languages

> The code you writing is rendered in a sandbox(iframe), and also a JavaScript sandbox (serving as an independent dynamic import).

### Syntax

````md
```jsx live
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

This will render as

```jsx live
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```

### Why?

Markdown naturally has code block syntax

For Example:

````md
```jsx
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

Your markdown might look like

````md
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";

<DemoBlock />;

```jsx
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

You will find that you write the statement twice.

And if your code has changes, you need to apply the changes twice.

## For Mobile

### Syntax

````md
```jsx live mobile
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";
<DemoBlock />;
```
````

Docit also support live mobile block. Add a `mobile` keyword after `live` to enable it.

```jsx live mobile
import { DemoBlock } from "../components/DemoBlock";

<DemoBlock />;
```

Docit provides a `360 * 640` mobile view to help you display responsive component
